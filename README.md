# **Coding Exercises**
Welcome to the Coding Exercises repository! This repository encompasses almost all the coding work completed during my Master's in Applied Informatics and while preparing for my final thesis. Here, I delved into various topics, including Python programming, machine learning methods, neural network models, and natural language processing (NLP) models.

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this repository is to showcase the progress and development of my coding skills throughout my Master's program. It encompasses a range of exercises and projects that explore different aspects of coding, with a particular focus on Python, machine learning, neural networks, and NLP models.

## **Contents**
This repository consists of the following components:
1. Python Exercises: A collection of Python coding exercises and projects aimed at developing fundamental programming skills and familiarity with Python libraries and syntax.
2. Machine Learning Methods: Implementations and experiments with various machine learning techniques, such as regression, SVM (Support Vector Machines), and other algorithms, exploring their applications in solving real-world problems.
3. Neural Network Models: Projects and code samples that explore different types of neural network models, including Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoencoders, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and more on MNIST, digital letters and other datasets.
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models: An exploration of NLP models, including BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), FinBERT (BERT specifically fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis), and other NLP techniques for text analysis and natural language understanding.
5. Final Thesis Preparation: This section includes code snippets, experiments, and project prototypes developed as part of my preparation for the final thesis. It covers various aspects related to the thesis topic, such as Forex prediction, sentiment analysis, and the integration of machine learning and NLP techniques.
